# Sales-Data-Analysis-Using-Excel

# Project Overview
This repository contains an ongoing analysis of a sales dataset aimed at answering questions related to sales performance, customer and product insights, as well as discount and pricing analysis. It also seeks to derive relevant insights that will be visualized through various charts and presented in an interactive dashboard.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to find answers related to the following key business questions:

### Sales Performance Analysis
- Which sales representative generated the highest total sales?  
- What is the total revenue generated per region?  
- What is the trend of sales over different months?

### Customer & Product Insights
- What is the most popular product category based on quantity sold?  
- How does the customer type (New vs. Returning) affect sales performance?  
- Which payment method is most commonly used?

### Discount & Pricing Analysis
- What is the average discount given per product category?  
- How does the percentage discount impact the total sales amount?

# Features

### 1. Chart Visualizations for Showing Patterns
- Various charts were created to visually represent patterns, trends, and relationships observed in the dataset.  
- These visualizations provide a clear understanding of key metrics and how they change over time or across categories.

### 2. Dashboard Overview
- An interactive dashboard was developed to present an overview of the insights and patterns identified during the analytical process.  
- The dashboard integrates multiple charts relevant to answering questions relating the goalof the analysis.

### 3. Pivot Tables for Chart Creation
- Pivot tables were generated to summarize, aggregate, and organize the dataset into meaningful dimensions.  
- These pivot tables served as the data foundation for building the various chart visualizations used in the dashboard.

### 4. Cleaned Dataset as Analytical Foundation
- The raw dataset was cleaned and transformed to remove inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors.  
- This cleaned dataset formed the basis for all subsequent pivot table generation, chart visualizations, mathematical computations, and dashboard construction.

- ## Interactive Excel Dashboard

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of key sales insights, enabling data-driven decision-making and performance tracking.
